## Introduction

This project was part of the [Parallel Programming](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/parallel-programming-PHYS-743) (PHYS-743) course at EPFL.

The latest and working version of the code can be found in "parallelizationGOOD" branch.

To Do:
- clean branches
- describe the algorithm
